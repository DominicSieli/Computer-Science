Time Complexity Analysis
- Access Complexity: Constant Time O(N)
- Searching Complexity: Linear Time O(N)
- Inserting Complexity: Linear Time O(1) / O(1)
- Deleting Complexity: Linear Time O(1) / O(1)

Functions
- Insert(T) O(1) / O(1)
- Delete(T) O(1) / O(1)
- Search(T) O(N)

Linked List: A linked list is a list of nodes that are dynamically allocated on the heap.
Each node is a stucture that contains an item value and a pointer to the next node.
Linked lists have zero memory overhead because nodes can be added or deleted as needed
without having to reallocate the whole list, unlike dynamically allocated arrays.
Linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory, resulting in cache misses and therefor
accessing elements in a linked list is slow compared to fixed or dynamic arrays.
