Data Structure: A data format in computer memory that implements operations on that memory.

Dynamic Data Structures: Allow updates and queries.

Static Data Structures: Allow queries but no updates.

Adaptive Data Structures: Changes the representation of the object to query more efficiently.

Common Operations: Creation/Deletion, Update, Query.

Note: Dynamic data structures are preferable because they are more
general, but static structures are useful as building blocks for dynamic structures.
