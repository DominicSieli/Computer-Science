Data Structure: A construct of data organization that groups data elements together and implements operations on that data.

Dynamic Data Structures: Allows updates and queries.

Static Data Structures: Allows queries but no updates.

Adaptive Data Structures: Changes structure to allow for more efficient update and query operations.

Common Operations: Add Data, Delete Data, Update Data, Query Data.

Note: Dynamic data structures are preferable because they are more
general, but static structures are useful as building blocks for dynamic structures.
