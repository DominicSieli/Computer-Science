-Time Complexity
1. O(1) Constant: Maximum Operations = 1
2. O(log(n)) Logarithmic: Maximum Operations = log(n)
3. O(n) Linear: Maximum Operations = n
4. O(n*log(n)) Linearithmic: Maximum Operations = n*log(n)
5. O(n^2) Quadratic: Maximum Operations = n^2
6. O(n^3) Cubic: Maximum Operations = n^3
7. O(n^x) Exponential: Maximum Operations = n^x
8. O(n!) Factorial: Maximum Operations = n!

O() O denotes upper bounds (worst case).
Ω() Omega denotes lower bounds (best case).
Θ() Theta denotes simultaneous upper and lower bounds.
Amortized Complexity: Diminishing cost over time.
