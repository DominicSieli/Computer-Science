Head: The first node.
Tail: The last node.
Node: The elemental unit of a linked list.

The abstract data-type object must have a pointer to the head node.
Linked List: A linked list is a list of nodes that are dynamically allocated on the heap.
Each node is a data stucture that contains an item value and a pointer to the next node.
Linked lists have zero memory overhead because nodes can be added or deleted as needed
without having to reallocate the whole list, unlike dynamically allocated arrays.
Linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory, resulting in cache misses and therefor
accessing elements in a linked list is slow compared to fixed or dynamic arrays.
