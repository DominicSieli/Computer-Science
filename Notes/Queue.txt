Queue:
Common operations:
Enqueue: Adds a new item to the back of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes the first item from the front of the queue.
IsEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.

Queues are FIFO (first in first out).

Queues are useful for cyclic tasks.

Queues are central to Breadth-First search algorithms.
