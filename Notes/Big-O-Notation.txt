O(1) = Constant Time
O(log(n)) = Logarithmic Time
O(n) = Linear Time
O(nlog(n)) = Linearithmic Time
O(n^2) = Quadratic Time
O(n^3) = Cubic Time
O(n^x) = Exponential Time
O(n!) = Factorial Time

O() O denotes upper bounds (worst case).
Ω() Omega denotes lower bounds (best case).
Θ() Theta denotes simultaneous upper and lower bounds.
Amortized Complexity: Diminishing cost over time.
